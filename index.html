                    <h1> In the Beginning... There Was a Riot... of Celebration</h1>
                    <p>Michigan’s Wolverines had been playing Minnesota’s Golden Gophers
                      off and on since 1892, but in 1903, this year was different. With
                      29 straight victories under its belt, Michigan’s “Yost’s machine”
                      squad prepared to take on “Doc” Williams’ veteran, 10-0 Minnesota
                      squad at Northrop Field for the “Championship of the West.”</p>
                        <p>As the Wolverines arrived in Minneapolis for the big game,
                          Yost had a moment of paranoia. Fearing shenanigans or
                          tampering by their rivals, he ordered Tommy Roberts, a
                          student manager, to purchase a jug for water for his team at
                          a local shop. A five-gallon Red Wing Pottery jug was purchased
                          for 30 cents, and the much-anticipated game began. The teams
                          battled fiercely through a scoreless first half. Michigan
                          scored first, taking a 6-0 lead midway through the second half.
                          With two minutes left in the game, the Gophers crossed the goal
                          line to even the score. Minnesota fans erupted in celebration and
                          rushed the field, which forced referees to call the game—at a tie.</p>
                          <p>Thanks to the chaos on the field and Michigan’s scramble to
                            catch their train home, Yost’s jug was forgotten, abandoned
                            in Minneapolis. The Gophers’ equipment manager Oscar Munson
                            found it and gave it to Munson. Minnesota’s athletic director,
                            L.J. Cooke decided to decorate it to commemorate the results
                            of the game. They painted the evening’s score (6-6), making
                            Minnesota’s “6” larger than Michigan’s, with the caption
                            “Michigan Jug Captured by Oscar, October 31, 1903.Cooke
                            suggested the teams play for its return. Yost agreed that
                            playing for the jug could make a fine tradition, and the teams
                            prepared for a rematch in Minneapolis on November 20, 1909… the
                            rest is history</p>
